Firstly thankyou for providing the opportunity for the virtual internship program. While going though the resources from this task made me realize a lot of things, as to how upskilling is an essential feature for any kind of development. Learning does not end just by obtaining any graduate degree and getting into job. Everyone should understand that improving one's skills, knowledge is necessity in this growing technology. I understand the fact that the world is filled with innovations in technology, it is just not about being a user, but we should also be a part of it's creation so that we do not lag behind. Can we imagine a life without it? I think it is highly impossible. According to my insights, upskilling should not only be implemented by the companies rather educational institutes should also take the initiative to bring it into force in every aspect of the child's education, where the students just lean the fewer subjects that is repeated all long their schooling which creates a huge gap, when they have to opt for the jobs for their financial support. 
I heartly thank PwC for these internships that helped me to figure out the understanding of the theoretical part that has been done and implement in these internships. I am hoping to get an hands on experience on how to analyze, visualize the data and interpret the possible outcomes.
