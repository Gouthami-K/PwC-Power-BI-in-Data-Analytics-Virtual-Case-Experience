The internship included 4 tasks:
## Introduction
All in on digital transformation: Creating a stronger, nimbler, more resilient future!\
The Digital Accelerator programme is an internal chance that takes groups of the employees out of their day jobs and puts them through trainings that teaches them skills in technology such as automation, machine learning, design thinking, and digital storytelling. PowerBI is an important part of it as visualising data helps to handle and understand clients.\
